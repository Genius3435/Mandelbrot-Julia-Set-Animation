# Mandelbrot/Julia Set Animation

This is a neat animation of the relation between a point on the Mandelbrot Set and the Julia Set corresponding to that point.

Move your mouse around the left half of the screen, and watch the corresponding Julia Set appear on the right.

## How to run the program

You need to have `rust` (at least 1.50) installed. You can install it [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Then `git clone` this repo (or download with the button that says `Code`), and run `cargo run --release` in the terminal.
